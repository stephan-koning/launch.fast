## Getting Started

Directions are also found on the [docs](https://sanitypress.dev/docs).

### 1. New repo

Clone, fork or use the template from [the GitHub template](https://github.com/nuotsu/sanitypress).

### 2. Get a new Sanity project ID

From the [Sanity.io Manage](https://sanity.io/manage) dashboard, create a new project _from scratch (blank schema) with CLI_.

### 3. Update environment variables

```sh
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL = ...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID = ...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_TOKEN = ... # retrieve from https://sanity.io/manage
```

### 4. Populate the Studio with content

Open your new Sanity Studio and add (and publish):

1. a **Site** document with a `title` field.
2. a **Page** document with the slug `index` to use as the Home page.
3. [Optional] a **Page** document with the slug `404` to use as the _Page not found_ page.

### 5. Set up deployments

Update the **Root Directory** (Vercel) / **Project Directory** (Netlify) with a value of `next`. This tells the deployment service to serve the next/ directory and not the root.

Optionally, install either of the following plugins to add a widget to your Studio Dashboard:

```sh
# Vercel ‚Äî https://www.sanity.io/plugins/vercel-dashboard-widget
npm i sanity-plugin-dashboard-widget-vercel

# Netlify ‚Äî https://www.sanity.io/plugins/sanity-plugin-dashboard-widget-netlify
npm i sanity-plugin-dashboard-widget-netlify
```

### 6. Customize the frontend

Feel free to adjust styles, add more schema and modules, and more.

## Staging

Create a new git branch (call it anything‚Äîe.g. `staging` or `preview`) and set an environment variable specific to that branch in your deployment service (Vercel or Netlify):

```sh
# Environment variable for the staging branch (in Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
ENABLE_PREVIEW = true
```

Now you can use the preview deployment URL to share staged content (unpublished changes) with your team or clients.
